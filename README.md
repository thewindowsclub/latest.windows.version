## The Latest Version of Windows Is Windows 11, Version 21H2

At the time of writing, the latest current version of Windows 11 is 21H2. The latest cumulative Quality update is 2022-05 KB 5013943.

### A New User Interface (UI)

Windows 11 has a completely revamped UI. This new version of the Windows interface reimagines the Start Menu setup found in previous versions of Windows, such as Windows 7 and 10. The “Metro” tile system seen in Windows 8 and 8.1 is completely gone, even the vestiges that existed within Windows 10. The Taskbar is now centered in a way reminiscent of Apple macOS and iOS for iPad. However, it can be aligned left if you wish. The Search Bar is now also at the very top of the menu.

## Windows 11 Comes in Different Editions

Windows 11 comes in several editions:

* Home.
* Pro.
* Education.
* Enterprise.
* Pro Education.
* Pro for Workstations.
* Mixed Reality.
* Windows Server

## How to Update to the Latest Version of Windows ?

Whether you’re on Windows 10 or are already a Windows 11 user, all you have to do to initiate an update is head to Start Menu Button > Settings App > Windows Update.

You’ll either see pending updates or that you are up to date. Choose whether to install updates immediately or manually check for updates by selecting Check for Updates. Windows will handle the rest.

If you’re a Windows 10 user who wishes to update to Windows 11 and the update isn’t showing for you, go to the Windows 11 download page and choose the best installation method. We suggest trying the Windows 11 Installation Assistant first, but if you want to update a different computer, you can use the Media Creation tool or burn a downloaded ISO file to a disc. If you have a Windows 10 license key, you can use it to activate Windows 11.
